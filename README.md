# Plant Disease Detection using AI
## Summary

This project aims to develop an AI-based system that detects plant diseases from images of their leaves. 
This will help farmers and gardeners diagnose problems quickly and take appropriate action to protect their crops.


## Background

Plant diseases are a major threat to global food security.

    Many farmers, especially in rural areas, lack easy access to experts for disease identification.
    Crop losses due to plant diseases are frequent and costly.
    Early detection is crucial to minimize damage and optimize treatments.

I find this topic fascinating because it combines artificial intelligence with agricultural sustainability, offering real benefits to smallholder farmers.

## How is it used?

Image Collection: Users take photos of plant leaves using a smartphone.
Model Analysis: The application detects the presence of a disease and provides information about it.
Recommendations: The system suggests treatments or preventive measures.

Example Use Case:
A farmer notices yellow and spotted leaves in their field. They take a photo, upload it to the app, and instantly receive a diagnosis along with possible solutions.

## Data sources and AI methods

Data Sources:

    PlantVillage Dataset: A labeled dataset of healthy and diseased plant leaves.

AI Methods:

    Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification.
    Data augmentation techniques to improve the modelâ€™s performance on a limited dataset.
    Frameworks used: TensorFlow or PyTorch.
    
## Challenges

Data Limitations: Some rare diseases may not be represented in the dataset.
Field Usage: Images may have poor quality (low light, blurry).
Ethical Considerations: The AI-generated advice must be reliable to avoid worsening the problem.

## What next?

Model Improvement: Add field-collected data to broaden the range of diseases detected.
IoT Integration: Pair the system with environmental sensors to predict diseases.
Accessibility: Develop an offline version for rural areas without internet access.
